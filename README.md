# Spotify Clone

This is a frontend Spotify clone built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The project simulates a basic music player interface with some pre-loaded songs stored in the `assets` folder.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.

## Hooks Utilized

This project utilizes several React hooks to manage state, side effects, and routing:

- `useState`: To manage component state.
- `useEffect`: To handle side effects like fetching data or updating the DOM.
- `useContext`: To manage and share state across different components.
- `useNavigate`: For programmatically navigating between routes.
- `useLocation`: To access the current location object, allowing for better route management.

## Project Description

This project is purely a frontend application that mimics the UI of Spotify. The songs used in this project are stored in the `assets` folder, and the application is designed to work with those files.
